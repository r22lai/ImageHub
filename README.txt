The App is build on MacOS.
1. Compile and Run:
	- gradle build

2. Requirements:
- You must test using a Pixel (Google Phone) AVD using API 28.
- You need to Android SDK API 28 to build your application (the latest released version at the time of this assignment).
- You can use either Android Studio or IntelliJ, at your discretion. The course examples use Java 8 and IntelliJ 2019.1, but Android Studio can also be used, as long as the project builds using gradle from the command-line. Instructions to install and configure IntelliJ are included in the Android development slides.
- You can use any functionality included in the Android SDK, and are free to use code snippets from the Android sample code included with the SDK (i.e. a snippet being a small segment of code). You can also use any code that we introduce in the course (i.e. from the CS 349 Git repo). If you do this, put comments in your code referencing the original source. You are not allowed to use any other third-party code or libraries, unless you obtain permission from the instructor (permission on Piazza is fine).
- Your project must build from the command-line using Gradle. i.e. `gradle build` to build it. In your submission, you also need to explicitly include the APK file (see below).
